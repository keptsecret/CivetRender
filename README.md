# CivetRender

Civet Rendering Engine is a small rendering engine, planning to fully support in-depth rasterization and raytracing methods.  
A lot of the engine is as much a learning process for the author as a (hopefully) useful tool.  

## Features

By the end, Civet will be a fully featured rendering engine, written in OpenGL C++ and CUDA.  
The raytracing implementation is derived from [PBRT](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3), and will support importing external scene files like `.obj`.
GPU accelerated rendering features is baked in but not currently fully implemented.

It is yet to be seen as to how far the author gets with this project.
